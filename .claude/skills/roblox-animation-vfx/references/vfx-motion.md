# VFX motion and held forms

Load this with `vfx-design.md` and `vfx-craft.md` for anything that travels,
sweeps or is held: projectiles, volleys, trails, beams, slashes, dashes,
teleports, orbs, sigils and auras.

## Projectiles, slashes, beams and sustained forms

**Projectiles** *(measured)*. A projectile has three parts:
- **A head:** one sprite, such as a `VelocityParallel` diamond. Clear it at
  impact (`Clear()`), so it vanishes in that frame.
  - To point it along a curved path, emit it with the projectile's own
    velocity: not locked to the part, the part turned to face along the path
    each frame, and `Speed` set to the projectile's speed each frame, with
    `Rotation` -90 for a head drawn point up *(verified: a missile run's
    heads led with their point this way)*. A `FacingCamera` head that looks
    alike from every angle needs none of this.
- **Ribbons:** 2-3 textured Trails across a span of about 5 studs (see
  "Beams and trails" below for drawing trail textures):
  - a sharp one: lifetime about 0.6, width tapering to 0, transparent for the
    first 15% of its length so there is a gap behind the head;
  - a soft one that bulges in the middle: lifetime about 0.85;
  - a short tendril: lifetime about 0.3.
- **Shed particles:** droplets or specks at 15-60 a second, with gravity or
  drag, not locked to the part.

Paths and volleys:
- **Paths:** Bezier curves with 2-3 random control points 10-25 studs up.
  - Give each projectile its own flight time (0.65-1.5 s), so the hits drum
    rather than land together.
  - A summoned dragon swirls about 45 studs sideways.
- **Volleys:** 10-15 sources, one every 0.1 s, fanned ±20 studs behind and
  above the caster. Each source's emitters stop after 0.1-0.2 s, and their
  particles close it over 0.8-1.5 s.

**Anything that moves carries its speed** *(measured)*:
- `VelocityParallel` streaks shed behind it, with `Squash`;
- flat wind rings shed backwards: negative Speed, growing to 7-12 studs over
  0.3-0.6 s;
- curved wind beams from head to tail;
- a one-frame smear at launch.

A projectile that is only a sprite with a thin trail reads as floating, not
thrown.

**Slashes are drawn in time, not only in space.** One crescent sprite (flat,
about 6.6 studs, 0.2-0.3 s) plus about five invisible points along the arc.
Each point emits sparks at an `EmitDelay` 0.04-0.05 s after the one before, so
the eye follows the blade around the arc.

**Stabs and dashes:**
- A one-frame (0.04 s) flash moving at 155-444 studs a second, with `Squash`
  -0.5, reads as a motion smear.
- Pair it with a real move: about 15 studs in 0.075 s.

**Held beams.** Use a few Beams plus many particles:
- **The body:** 2-3 camera-facing Beams, width 5-12.
  - Give each its own `TextureLength` (0.75-150) and `TextureSpeed` (1-12), so
    the scrolls never line up.
  - Fade the ends over 5-10% of the length, or make the body a capsule
    (Transparency `1, 0, 1` along it).
- **Fill:** `VelocityParallel` flame streaks at `Rate` 500-2000, Speed up to
  300, Drag 10, `Squash` ramping 0 to 3.
- **The muzzle:** a crown of short curved beams, and flat shockwave rings.
- **Duration:** hold the beam 3.5-5 s, then collapse the widths to 0 over
  0.5-1 s.
- **A drilling dash:** three beams around one axis that roll 180° while
  their widths fall from 6 to 0 over 0.75 s.

**Teleports and blinks:**
- an implosion flash (31 to 0 over 0.23 s) with `Squash` glitch frames;
- upward streaks at 45-200 studs a second with drag 4-9, dying in 0.12-0.4
  s;
- a white ground ring growing from 1 to 19 in 0.14 s.

**Sustained forms:** orbs, sigils and auras.
- **The stack:** stationary billboards on one attachment, with `Speed` 0.001
  and `LockedToPart`.
- **The cross-fade:** `Rate` x `Lifetime` about 2-4, Transparency `0:1,
  0.5:0, 1:1` and a random `Rotation`. Copies cross-fade, so the form holds but
  shimmers.
- **Size ladder:** core 1, rings about 2, halo about 3.5, black backdrop about
  4.5.
- **Ground sigils:** 5-7 studs, lifetime 2, spinning 0.5-5° a second, in two
  or three sizes that shrink slightly as they live, so the circle breathes.
- **Healing over time pulses:** a burst every 1.6 s with lifetimes up to 1.25
  s, so the pulses read as ticks.

## Beams and trails

- **Beams:**
  - A Beam is a curve between two attachments. `CurveSize0` and `CurveSize1`
    bend it into an arc.
  - Give it enough `Segments` to look smooth: at least one fewer than the
    number of Color and Transparency keypoints, and 20 or more for a visible
    curve. The studied slash beams use 100-360.
  - `TextureSpeed` scrolls the texture along the beam, the one built-in way
    to scroll a texture. Use it for flowing energy, lasers and lightning
    arcs.
  - **Launch beams** *(measured)*: a beam whose width starts at 40-200 and
    tweens to 0 over 0.15-0.4 s, with a transparency band that is clear at
    both ends (`0:1, 0.5:0, 1:1`), reads as a streak passing through.
- **Linking:** `build_instances` cannot set a Beam's or Trail's
  `Attachment0`/`Attachment1`. Build everything, then link them in one
  `execute_luau` (`trail.Attachment0, trail.Attachment1 = inner, outer`) and
  read the result back.
- **Trails** draw a ribbon behind two attachments as they move.
  - For a weapon slash, put the attachments at the base and tip of the blade
    and keep the trail disabled. Enable it only for the swing
    (`EmitDelay` and `EmitDuration`, timed to the animation).
  - Weapon trails come in pairs *(measured)*:
    - a thin hot core: Lifetime 0.04-0.15, Brightness 10-30;
    - a wide, soft, dark or coloured wisp: Lifetime 0.15-0.4,
      `LightEmission` 0.55-0.75.
    Both have a `WidthScale` that tapers to 0.
  - **Give every trail a texture** *(measured: 58 of 66 studied trails have
    one)*. Without one, a Trail is an even band of colour: a missile volley's
    three untextured trails read as flat purple tubes *(verified)*. The
    studied textures are streaks, such as a bright torn or dripping edge with
    streaks running back from it, a tapered shard, or a wisp. Their clear
    areas also hide part of the ribbon, so widen it or raise `Brightness` to
    keep its weight *(verified: the same volley with textures read thinner
    and fainter)*.
  - **Which way a texture lies** *(verified)*: on a Trail or a Beam, the
    image's vertical axis runs along its length and its horizontal axis
    across its width. On a Trail the top of the image is at the head and the
    bottom at the tail, and its left edge is at `Attachment0`. Draw trail and
    beam textures as vertical strips; a drawing made lengthwise comes out
    turned across the ribbon.
- **A crescent slash without a mesh:** sweep a trail through an arc.
  - Make a Model with `Start` and `End` parts at the same CFrame, both
    invisible, and give it `Spin` (160), `Duration` (0.14) and `Easing`
    `Quart` `Out`.
  - Put two Attachments on `Start` at the blade's inner and outer radius,
    along -Z. A narrow band reads as a crescent; a wide one reads as a fan.
  - A Trail between them, with `FaceCamera = false` and a width tapering to
    0, draws the crescent as `Start` spins.
  - Roll the whole effect for a diagonal swing. A flat slash seen from a
    low camera is edge-on and almost invisible, so check it from the game's
    real camera height.

## Orb skeleton

**Orb** (a sustained form: every layer at Speed 0.001, `LockedToPart`, `Rate`
2-4, Lifetime 0.5-1, Transparency `0:1, 0.5:0, 1:1`, random `Rotation`; front to
back):

| ZOffset | Role | Make |
| --- | --- | --- |
| +0.4 | Black linework | A spiral or rune sheet, 1R, black |
| +0.3 | Hard ring | `LightEmission` 0, Brightness 20-150, 0.9R |
| +0.1 | Black pupil | A small disc pulsing 0.15-0.5R |
| 0 | Core | Rays and fill, `LightEmission` 1, Brightness 5-10, 0.45R, `RotSpeed` ±10-20 |
| -1 | Outer ring | `LightEmission` 1, Brightness 1-4, growing 0.9-1.5R |
| -1.05 | Halo | A soft blob, `LightEmission` 1, Brightness 0.3, 1.6R |
| -1.1 | Black backdrop | A soft black blob, 2R, and a black disc 0.6R behind the core |

## Example: a slash trail

Slash trail, the hot core of a pair (on the weapon; the attachments are at the
base and tip of the blade; time `EmitDelay` to the swing):
