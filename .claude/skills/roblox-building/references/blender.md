# Modeling in Blender

Use this whenever the `blender` tool is offered and [What gets
modeled](mesh-boundary.md) says a piece is modeled, which with Blender on is
every visual piece. Write the brief in [Modeling a mesh](modeling.md) first.
The tool exists only while the user has turned Blender on in Roqer's Settings.
If it is not offered, do not ask for it or pretend to have run it: build from
Parts, and tell the user they can turn Blender on for modeled visuals.

## What a job is

One `blender` call runs one Python script in the user's own Blender, in the
background. `bpy` is imported and `OUTPUT_DIR` is defined. The script starts on
an empty scene, or, with `continue_from` set to an earlier job's id, on the
scene that job saved. Every job whose script finishes saves its scene, and its
result gives the job's id and lists the scene's objects by name, size and
centre, so the next job reads what exists rather than recalling it. A chat's
first job leaves `continue_from` out: no id stands for an empty scene.

A small prop is one job. A detailed model is built in stages, one job per
stage, each continuing from the last: for a vehicle, the frame; then the body
panels; then the running gear; then the cockpit and details. Look at each
stage's preview before starting the next, and fix what is wrong while it is
the newest stage: a fix is a short script that changes the objects already
there, by name (`bpy.data.objects["Left_Side_Pod"].location.z += 0.2`), not a
rebuild. A job that fails saves nothing and the next attempt starts from the
last job that worked; to undo a step, continue from an earlier job.

Read the listing as well as the preview. It names what a small preview hides:
a left and right pair (`Fender_L`, `Fender_R`) that does not mirror, which is
usually a side sign the script forgot to flip, and geometry at NaN positions,
which an export fails on. Fix those in the next job, before building on them.

Every job is irreversible: the user approves it unless they run in Full auto,
so make each job a real stage, not a probe, and do not split one stage across
several jobs. A script may be at most 60,000 characters, and one that long
takes minutes to write: build repeated parts (wheels, bolts, tube runs, vents)
with loops and small functions rather than writing each one out.

Export once, when the model is ready to upload, with `use_visible=True`: an
export otherwise includes hidden helper objects such as boolean cutters. A job
that exports nothing is still checked and previewed from its saved scene.

The script must:

- build everything with `bpy`: a new model starts from the empty scene, and a
  continued one from the scene its earlier job saved; nothing else is loaded;
- model at the size it should have in Studio: one Blender unit arrives as one
  stud, so a barrel is about 4 units tall, not 1;
- name its objects and materials for what they are (`Barrel`, `BarrelWood`);
- face the model's front toward −Y: Blender (x, y, z) arrives in Roblox at
  (−x, z, y), so −Y becomes Roblox's forward (−Z, the `LookVector`), and a
  front built toward +Y arrives backwards;
- colour the model in Blender, with vertex colours or a packed image texture
  (see [Modeling a mesh](modeling.md), "Colour and material"). Both survive the
  upload; a flat material base colour does not, and arrives white;
- when the model is ready, export into `OUTPUT_DIR` and nowhere else, normally
  one GLB, with modifiers applied (without `export_apply=True` a bevel or
  mirror never reaches Roblox) and only visible objects:
  `bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(filepath=os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, "barrel.glb"), export_format="GLB", export_apply=True, use_visible=True)`;
- read or write no other files and use no network.

### Roqer's helpers

Every job also has `roqer`, a few helpers that build parts directly, in studs.
They place a part by where it starts and ends, so there is no rotation angle to
get the direction of wrong, and they paint it when given a colour:

- `roqer.box(name, size, center, rgba)`: an upright box of size `(x, y, z)`.
- `roqer.box_between(name, start, end, width, thickness, width_axis=(1, 0, 0), rgba)`:
  a box running from `start` to `end`, `width` wide along `width_axis`. A
  leaning seat back runs from its bottom edge to its top edge; a sloping panel
  from its low end to its high end.
- `roqer.cylinder_between(name, start, end, radius, rgba, vertices=12)`: a
  cylinder whose caps sit at `start` and `end`: a bar, a pipe, a column, an
  axle, or a wheel from its inner face to its outer face.
- `roqer.cone_between(name, start, end, start_radius, end_radius=0, rgba, vertices=12)`:
  a cone or taper whose start radius sits at `start` and end radius at `end`
  (0 is a point). A boost flame runs from the exhaust, its wide end, to its tip;
  a spike from its base to its point.
- `roqer.join(name, objects)`: joins parts that never move apart into one
  flat-shaded object with a vertex-colour material. Join each moving part (a
  wheel, a lid, a door) on its own.
- `roqer.paint(obj, rgba)` and `roqer.vertex_color_material()`, for parts made
  another way.
- `roqer.piece(obj, pivot, parent=None)`: makes a joined object a moving piece
  of a creature (see "A creature of moving pieces"): its origin goes to
  `pivot` without moving its shape, its mesh is named after it, and it hangs
  from `parent`.
- `roqer.bind(obj, bones)` and `roqer.skin(obj, bones, name="Armature")`: for
  a creature that bends (see "A creature that bends"): bind says which bones a
  part follows, and skin makes the armature and weights the joined mesh.
- `roqer.export_animation(name, source, rig, start=None, end=None, loop=True)`:
  bakes what a creature does in the scene into an animation for Studio (see
  "Animating a creature in Blender").
- `roqer.draw_flipbook(name, frame, grid=4, ...)` and `roqer.draw_texture`,
  with `roqer.tex_coords`, `tex_polar`, `tex_noise`, `tex_cells`, `tex_sample`,
  `tex_edge` and `tex_ease`: draw particle textures and flipbooks in 2D with
  numpy (see the `roblox-animation-vfx` skill's `references/vfx-textures.md`).
- `roqer.flipbook(name, grid=4, mode="alpha", start=None, end=None, loop=False, padding=4)`:
  renders the scene's animation into a 1024 x 1024 particle flipbook sheet
  (that skill's `references/vfx-rendered-flipbooks.md`).
- `roqer.vfx_arc`, `vfx_ring`, `vfx_cone`, `vfx_swirl` and `vfx_shell`: shapes
  for mesh effects (a crescent slash, a shockwave, a burst, a tornado, a
  barrier), each with UVs laid out along its sweep. `roqer.vfx_surface`
  builds any other shape from a function (see that skill's `references/vfx-mesh-shapes.md`).

Prefer them for any part that is not upright. Raw `bpy` is still available for
shapes they do not cover; there, keep the model flat-shaded (no
`shade_smooth` on hard edges) and apply a rotation only after checking its
direction (see "Reading the result").

A script that raises returns Blender's traceback. Fix the cause and run the
corrected script; after two failed attempts at the same model, stop and report
what is failing instead of escalating.

## Reading the result

Roqer does not trust the script. It re-imports each exported model and returns
its triangles, meshes, materials and size, its layout, and a preview of four
views in one image: the side from +X, the top, and three-quarter views from two
opposite corners.

- The preview is how you check the model, but it is not evidence of the
  place: Roqer's completion check counts only what Studio shows. In a task
  list, a task that only models in Blender asks for no evidence; ask for
  visual evidence on the task that inserts the model, and take a Studio
  screenshot there.
- Look at every view. A part that looks right from one angle can lean the wrong
  way, float, or pass through another part in the side or top view. If the
  silhouette or colours are wrong, fix the script; do not upload a model you
  have not seen.
- Read the layout. It gives each finding in your script's own Blender
  coordinates, naming a piece by the size and centre your script gave it, so
  find the line that made it:
  - a piece attached to nothing, in its own object or any other, is almost
    always a gap: move it until it meets the part it belongs to;
  - separate objects passing into each other are wrong for a part that must
    move freely, and fine where one is meant to sit inside the other;
  - an object touching no other object is right for a kit set, and a gap in one
    assembled model;
  - the lowest point should be at Z 0 for a model that stands on the ground.
- A shading line means the model is smooth-shaded across hard edges, which
  makes boxes and panels look puffy. Remove `shade_smooth` unless the object is
  meant to look rounded.
- When a part is angled and a finding shows it missing what it should meet,
  check the rotation's direction before moving it: a positive rotation about X
  lifts the +Y end, about Y lowers the +X end, and about Z turns +X toward +Y.
- Keep triangles low. A prop rarely needs more than a few thousand; stay well
  under Roblox's per-mesh triangle limit, and split a large model into parts.
- Sizes are in Blender units, which arrive as studs. Still measure the model
  after it is inserted rather than trusting the number.

## A kit set in one upload

A map's visual pieces are made together: one job, one file, one upload, then
split into kit templates in Studio. That costs two approvals for the whole set
instead of two per piece. It is verified (`npm run eval:kits`): three
vertex-coloured pieces in one GLB, sharing one material, arrived as three
MeshParts, each named after its object, in its colours and at its modeled
size.

1. **One script builds every kit.** Make each kit one object: join its parts,
   and name the object and its mesh data for the kit (`Tree_A`, `CliffEdge_A`,
   `Rock_B`). Model each at its stud size, standing on the ground plane, and
   space them apart so none overlap. Their spacing does not survive the
   upload, so never rely on it.
2. **One material for the set is enough:** a vertex-colour material shared by
   every kit. Give a kit a second material only where a surface needs its own
   Roblox `Material` or transparency, and expect that kit to arrive as one
   MeshPart per material.
3. **Export one GLB and check Roqer's list.** It names every object with its
   size; each becomes its own MeshPart named after it.
4. **Upload once** (`assetType: 'Model'`) and `insert_asset` the result into a
   staging Model under the registry's `Templates`, for example
   `RoqerWorld.Templates.Import_1`.
5. **Split it with one `build_instances` batch rooted at `Templates`.** For
   each kit: `create` a Model named for the kit; `clone` its MeshPart into it
   with `CanCollide`, `CanTouch` and `CanQuery` off; `create` its collision
   Part (see "Collision" in [What gets modeled](mesh-boundary.md)); set a
   `RoqerAssetId` attribute. Then `remove` the staging Model. Each new Model
   gets an upright pivot at the centre of its bounds, so place a clone at the
   ground height plus half its height. Recognise each MeshPart by its
   name, or by the size Roqer listed if Roblox renamed it.
6. **Register the kits** in the registry's `Kit` folder and place them by
   cloning, like any template.

## A creature of moving pieces

A creature that will be animated (a wolf, a spider, a bird, a robot) is
modelled as separate pieces, one object for each part that moves on its own,
and rigged in Studio by the `animation` tool's `rig` action. An upload keeps
every piece where it was modelled but not where it turns, so the pivots leave
Blender in the job's result. Load the animation skill's
`references/creature-animation.md` before modelling: it names the pieces a
body plan needs.

- **One object per moving piece**, joined with `roqer.join`: the body; the
  head; the tail, or each tail segment; each leg as an upper and a lower
  piece, so it has a knee. Ears, eyes and teeth that never move on their own
  are joined into their piece. Give each piece one material.
- **Name pieces as the body plan does**, since each arrives as a MeshPart of
  that name: `Body`, `Head`, `Tail`, and for a four-legged body
  `FrontLeftUpper`, `FrontLeftLower`, `FrontRightUpper`, `FrontRightLower`,
  `HindLeftUpper` and so on. With the front toward −Y, the creature's left is
  Blender's +X.
- **`roqer.piece(obj, pivot, parent)` for every piece but the body**, after
  it is joined: `pivot` is the point the piece turns about, in the same
  coordinates the piece was built in. A leg's upper piece turns at the hip,
  inside the body; its lower piece at the knee, where the two overlap; the
  head at the back of the skull; the tail at its root. A pivot at a piece's
  middle makes it spin in place.
- **Overlap pieces at their joints** by a tenth of a stud or more, so a turn
  opens no gap. The layout does not report those overlaps.
- **Model it standing as it rests**: feet at Z 0, front toward −Y.
- **Bend each leg at rest**, as an animal's are. A leg modelled straight has
  no slack, so a walk can only stride by lowering the body and every knee
  stays bent: the creature walks crouched. Put each knee off the line from
  hip to foot by about 15% of the leg's height, a front knee forward (toward
  −Y) and a hind knee back (toward +Y), which is the way each folds. The leg
  then strides by straightening.
- Export one GLB as usual.

Read the result's **moving pieces** line. It lists anything that would rig
badly (an origin left at a piece's middle or outside both pieces it joins,
left and right pivots that do not mirror, a mesh named apart from its object,
a piece with two materials, a piece parented to nothing, legs modelled
straight or bent against their fold), each with what to
change: fix those in the next job before uploading, since an upload cannot be
changed. It ends with the `joints` to pass to `rig`, pivots included.

```python
import bpy, os

FUR, DARK, PALE = (0.45, 0.45, 0.48, 1), (0.2, 0.2, 0.22, 1), (0.8, 0.8, 0.78, 1)

# A low-poly wolf facing -Y, standing on Z 0, about 5 studs long.
body = roqer.join("Body", [
    roqer.box("chest", (1.3, 1.6, 1.3), (0, -0.8, 2.3), FUR),
    roqer.box("belly", (1.1, 1.8, 1.1), (0, 0.8, 2.25), FUR),
])

head = roqer.join("Head", [
    roqer.box("skull", (1.0, 1.0, 1.0), (0, -2.0, 2.9), FUR),
    roqer.box("snout", (0.5, 0.7, 0.45), (0, -2.8, 2.75), PALE),
    roqer.cone_between("ear_l", (0.3, -1.8, 3.3), (0.3, -1.8, 3.8), 0.18, 0, DARK, vertices=4),
    roqer.cone_between("ear_r", (-0.3, -1.8, 3.3), (-0.3, -1.8, 3.8), 0.18, 0, DARK, vertices=4),
])
roqer.piece(head, (0, -1.5, 2.7), body)          # the neck, inside the chest

tail = roqer.join("Tail", [roqer.box_between("t", (0, 1.6, 2.5), (0, 3.0, 2.0), 0.3, 0.3, rgba=DARK)])
roqer.piece(tail, (0, 1.6, 2.5), body)

# Blender +X is the wolf's left once it faces -Y. Each leg is bent at rest: its
# knee stands 0.3 off the line from hip to paw, a front knee forward, a hind knee back.
for end, y, bend in (("Front", -1.1, -0.3), ("Hind", 1.3, 0.3)):
    for side, x in (("Left", 0.45), ("Right", -0.45)):
        knee = (x, y + bend, 0.95)
        upper = roqer.join(f"{end}{side}Upper", [roqer.box_between("u", (x, y, 2.0), (x, y + bend * 1.1, 0.85), 0.42, 0.5, rgba=FUR)])
        lower = roqer.join(f"{end}{side}Lower", [
            roqer.box_between("l", (x, y + bend * 1.1, 1.05), (x, y, 0.1), 0.34, 0.4, rgba=FUR),
            roqer.box("paw", (0.4, 0.55, 0.2), (x, y - 0.08, 0.1), PALE),
        ])
        roqer.piece(upper, (x, y, 1.9), body)     # the hip or shoulder, inside the body
        roqer.piece(lower, knee, upper)           # the knee, where the two overlap

bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(filepath=os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, "wolf.glb"), export_format="GLB", export_apply=True, use_visible=True)
```

Then upload and insert it as in "Getting it into Studio", and rig it: the
creature reference's "From Blender" section has the call.

## A creature that bends: one skinned mesh

Pieces turn rigidly, which suits a blocky creature. A body that must bend
along its length (a snake, a fish, a tentacle, a worm, a long tail or neck)
is one mesh skinned to bones instead. The upload keeps the bones and the
weights, so nothing about the rig has to be carried to Studio by hand.

- **Bind each part to its bones as you make it**: `roqer.bind(part, "Head")`
  for a part that moves rigidly with one bone, `roqer.bind(part, ["Tail",
  "Tail2"])` for one that bends between several. A part left unbound is
  weighted among every bone by which lie nearest, which is right for a single
  tube and wrong for a leg beside a belly.
- **Run a limb up into the body it hangs from.** A part bound to several
  bones keeps its top with the bone above them: whatever of a leg lies above
  its hip stays with the spine, and blends into the leg just below the hip,
  so the thigh does not swing out of the rump as the leg turns. So start a
  leg's mesh a little above its upper bone's head, inside the body, and put
  that bone's head where the leg should turn. A part bound to one bone moves
  rigidly with it.
- **A part bends only where it has vertices.** A box has them at its ends, so
  build a bending length from several short segments end to end (a tail of six
  boxes, a snake of twenty), all bound to the same list of bones.
- **Join everything into one object** with `roqer.join`, then
  `roqer.skin(obj, bones)`. `bones` lists `(name, head, tail)` or
  `(name, head, tail, parent)`, parents first: each bone runs from `head` to
  `tail`, and a part turns about its bone's `head`. Keep to 63 bones or fewer.
- **Name bones as the body plan names pieces**: `Head`, `Tail`, `Tail2`, and
  for a four-legged body `FrontLeftUpper`, `FrontLeftLower` and
  `FrontLeftFoot` for each leg. The foot bone's head is at the sole, on Z 0:
  it is where the leg ends and where the foot meets the ground. Do not name a
  bone `Root`, or after the mesh; name the spine `Spine`.
- **Bend each leg at rest**, the mesh and its bones alike: the knee, which is
  the lower bone's head, off the line from hip to foot by about 15% of the
  leg's height, a front knee toward −Y and a hind knee toward +Y. A straight
  leg has no slack, and the creature walks crouched (see "A creature of
  moving pieces").
- Model it at rest, front toward −Y, feet on Z 0, and export one GLB as usual.

Read the result's **skinned** line. It names the mesh and its bones, and
lists what Roblox would not keep, each with what to change: a vertex no bone
holds, a vertex held by more than four bones, more than one mesh or armature,
a leg with no foot bone, legs modelled straight. It ends with the `rig` call,
which takes no joints.

```python
import bpy, os

GREEN, PALE = (0.3, 0.5, 0.28, 1), (0.75, 0.78, 0.6, 1)
names = [f"Spine{index + 1}" for index in range(8)]

# A snake facing -Y, 8 studs long, lying on Z 0: twenty short segments that
# bend along eight bones, and a head that moves with the first.
parts = [roqer.bind(roqer.box_between("head", (0, -4.6, 0.3), (0, -4.0, 0.3), 0.7, 0.5, rgba=GREEN), "Spine1")]
for index in range(20):
    y = -4 + index * 0.4
    parts.append(roqer.bind(roqer.box_between(f"s{index}", (0, y, 0.25), (0, y + 0.4, 0.25), 0.5, 0.5, rgba=GREEN if index % 2 else PALE), names))

bones = [(name, (0, -4 + index, 0.25), (0, -3 + index, 0.25), names[index - 1] if index else None) for index, name in enumerate(names)]
snake = roqer.join("Snake", parts)
roqer.skin(snake, bones)

bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(filepath=os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, "snake.glb"), export_format="GLB", export_apply=True, use_visible=True)
```

Then upload and insert it, and rig it: the creature reference's "A skinned
creature" section has the call.

## Animating a creature in Blender

Most creature motion is written for the `animation` tool directly: keys,
`waves` and `gait` (the animation skill's creature reference). Animate in
Blender instead when Blender's own tools make the motion: inverse
kinematics pulling a chain toward a moving target, a constraint that makes a
head track a point, a path, a physics bake. Roqer samples the result frame by
frame and hands the `animation` tool a pose description, so everything after
that (checks, previews, build, publish, wire) is the same.

- **Animate the scene the creature was exported from**: a second job with
  `continue_from` set to the job that made it. The armature is named
  `Armature`; a creature of pieces has its body piece. Leave the model as it
  is: an animation made on a body of another shape is refused in Studio.
- **Set the frames**: `scene.frame_start`, `scene.frame_end` and
  `scene.render.fps`. At most 60 seconds, sampled as up to 240 keyframes.
- **For a loop, the last frame is the first pose again.**
- **`roqer.export_animation(name, source, rig, start=None, end=None,
  loop=True)`** bakes it. `source` is the armature, or the body piece of a
  creature of pieces. `rig` is the path the model has, or will have, in
  Studio, such as `game.Workspace.Snake`: the model must be uploaded,
  inserted there and rigged before the animation is checked.
- A creature of pieces is at rest at `start`, so begin from the pose it was
  exported in.
- Only the body as a whole can travel: the root bone's, or the body piece's,
  change of place goes on the rig's `Root` joint. Any other bone or piece
  only turns, and a slide of its own is left out and reported.

The result lists each animation with its length, how many joints move, how
many keys were kept, and its file. Pass the file, not its contents:

```text
{ "action": "check", "animation_file": "<path from the job's result>", "locomotion": false }
```

then `build` with the same animation_file and a `parent`. A gait made this
way is checked with `locomotion: true` like any other. After publishing and
wiring it, `verify` with the model, the same animation_file, the published
animation_id and the `slot`, in a playtest, checks that the asset plays on
the model as checked and that the state holds it.

This job continues from the snake's and sweeps its tail from side to side
with inverse kinematics:

```python
import bpy, math

armature = bpy.data.objects["Armature"]
scene = bpy.context.scene
scene.frame_start, scene.frame_end, scene.render.fps = 1, 41, 20

# The last five bones reach for a target that swings across behind the snake and lifts.
target = bpy.data.objects.new("TailTarget", None)
scene.collection.objects.link(target)
reach = armature.pose.bones["Spine8"].constraints.new("IK")
reach.target, reach.chain_count = target, 5
for frame in range(1, 42):
    turn = 2 * math.pi * (frame - 1) / 40
    target.location = (1.6 * math.sin(turn), 3.6, 0.25 + 0.7 * abs(math.sin(turn)))
    target.keyframe_insert("location", frame=frame)

roqer.export_animation("TailSweep", armature, "game.Workspace.Snake")
```

## Getting it into Studio

For one model on its own; a map's set follows the section above.


1. `upload_asset {action: 'upload', filePath: <the exported path>, assetType: 'Model', displayName}`
   publishes it with the user's Open Cloud key. It is irreversible and asks for
   approval. If the result is pending, check it with `action: 'status'` rather
   than uploading again. With no key configured, send the user to Settings →
   Roblox Open Cloud.
2. `insert_asset` with the new asset id, into the build root or a kit's
   template folder.
3. Read the inserted model back: its MeshParts, size, pivot, anchoring,
   collision. It arrives as one MeshPart per object and material, named after
   it (`Barrel`, or `BarrelBody` and `BarrelBody2` for two materials), so tell
   them apart by name and size. Roqer's inspection said where the colour lives: for vertex
   colours or a texture, leave each MeshPart's `Color` white, which shows the
   colour unchanged; for flat material colours, set `Color` and `Material` on
   each part now. Scale the model if it is off, anchor it, and give it
   deliberate collision (see "Collision" in [What gets modeled](mesh-boundary.md)). Take a screenshot to confirm the colours.
4. Reuse it as a kit template: clone it for every placement. Never upload the
   same model twice. Record the asset ID as a `RoqerAssetId` attribute on the
   Model.
5. If it must be held, driven, opened or picked up, assemble it next: load
   [Gameplay assembly](gameplay-assembly.md).

## Visual effects

The `roblox-animation-vfx` skill covers Blender jobs for visual effects:
- `references/vfx-textures.md`: particle textures and flipbooks drawn with
  numpy, previewed in Studio before uploading;
- `references/vfx-rendered-flipbooks.md`: flipbooks rendered from a scene;
- `references/vfx-mesh-shapes.md`: shapes for mesh effects, such as crescents,
  rings, swirls and shells.

Load those, not this reference, before a VFX job.

## Rendering an image for UI

A job may render PNGs into `OUTPUT_DIR` instead of, or as well as, exporting
a model: an inventory icon, a shop thumbnail, a badge. Roqer attaches each PNG
as it is, with its pixel size read from the file. Look at it before uploading.

- Render with Workbench: it is fast and needs no lights. Set
  `scene.display.shading.color_type` to where the colour lives: `"VERTEX"` for
  vertex colours, `"TEXTURE"` for an image texture. For flat material colours
  use `"MATERIAL"`, which draws a material's viewport colour, not its node
  colour, so set `material.diffuse_color` to the same RGBA as the base colour.
- Transparent background: `scene.render.film_transparent = True` and
  `scene.render.image_settings.color_mode = "RGBA"`.
- Square and no larger than 1024 pixels a side (Roblox keeps no more); 512 is
  enough for an icon. Frame the object so it fills most of the square.
- Upload it with `upload_asset {action: 'upload', filePath, assetType: 'Decal', displayName}`.
  Use the result's `imageId` in `ImageLabel.Image` as `rbxassetid://<imageId>`.
  The `decalId` does not display in an ImageLabel. If `imageId` is null, check
  the upload again with action `status`, which resolves it once Roblox has
  processed the image.
- Build the UI around it with the `roblox-gui` or `roblox-ui-design` skill.

## Example

```python
import bpy, os

WOOD, IRON = (0.45, 0.28, 0.14, 1), (0.2, 0.2, 0.22, 1)

# Stud scale: 4 studs tall, 3.6 across. A cylinder is given by its two end caps.
body = roqer.cylinder_between("BarrelBody", (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 4.0), 1.8, WOOD)
hoops = [roqer.cylinder_between(f"Hoop{i}", (0, 0, z - 0.1), (0, 0, z + 0.1), 1.86, IRON) for i, z in enumerate((0.7, 3.3))]
# A part at an angle is given by its two ends, never by a rotation: this tap
# starts inside the barrel wall and runs out and down.
tap = roqer.cylinder_between("Tap", (0, -1.7, 1.0), (0, -2.2, 0.8), 0.08, IRON)

# One object, one vertex-colour material, flat-shaded: it arrives as a single
# MeshPart in its colours.
roqer.join("Barrel", [body, *hoops, tap])

bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(filepath=os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, "barrel.glb"), export_format="GLB", export_apply=True, use_visible=True)

# Optional: a transparent 512 px icon of the same barrel for an inventory slot.
