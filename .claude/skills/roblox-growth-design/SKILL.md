# Roblox Growth Design

## When to Load

Load for weak growth, discovery, retention, onboarding, packaging, or LiveOps. Diagnose here, then route implementation to domain skills.

## Quick Reference

### Diagnose before prescribing

1. Ask for dashboard evidence, release dates, acquisition mix, and observed sessions. Never invent metrics.
2. Find the narrowest broken transition: impression to play, join to control, first action to payoff, return, or purchase.
3. Write a falsifiable hypothesis: **If Y changes because evidence Z, X should move without harming G.**
4. Prefer one interpretable experiment with a primary metric, counter-metrics, MDE, and decision rule.
5. Stop for safety, severe regressions, or invalid instrumentation. Avoid significance peeking.

### Home diagnosis

- Low QPTR: packaging readability, promise accuracy, or audience mismatch.
- Bounce under 3 min: join failure, performance, confusing FTUE, or delayed payoff.
- Low D1: core loop, onboarding, stability, goals, or first payoff.
- Low D7/D30: progression, variety, social value, LiveOps, endgame, or exhaustion.
- Low conversion/ARPPU: product fit, value communication, friction, catalog depth, or concentration.

These are hypotheses, not one-to-one causes. Segment and test. Per-stat tactics in full.md §3–§6.

### Guardrails

Use accurate metadata. Avoid dark patterns, deceptive odds, coercive scarcity, and "whale" targeting. Treat platform input, moderation, abuse, accessibility, localization, performance, and economy health as constraints.
