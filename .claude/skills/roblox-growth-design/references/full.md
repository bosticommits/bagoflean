# Roblox Growth Design: Full Reference

> Examples, thresholds, and practitioner playbooks are starting hypotheses, not universal laws. Verify platform behavior against the dated sources, adapt to the game and audience, and test before broad rollout.

This reference combines Roblox's published discovery and analytics guidance with original practitioner synthesis. Sections labeled **Official** restate current Creator Hub behavior. Sections labeled **Heuristic** are diagnostic lenses, not claims about the recommendation algorithm.

## 1. Operating Model

A game-design diagnosis should connect four layers:

1. **Promise:** what audience the title, icon, thumbnails, and premise attract.
2. **First session:** join reliability, comprehension, time-to-fun, and the first core-loop payoff.
3. **Long-term game:** progression, variety, social value, identity, mastery, and LiveOps.
4. **Business:** transparent products that add player value without damaging trust or the economy.

Do not jump from a weak metric to a feature prescription. A metric is an observation. Several causes can produce the same observation, and one change can move several metrics.

### Evidence hierarchy

Use the strongest available evidence:

1. Roblox Experiments with an adequate minimum detectable effect (MDE), full planned duration, confidence intervals, and stable variants.
2. Cohort or release comparisons with acquisition source, platform, locale, player age, and seasonality controlled where practical.
3. Funnels, session traces, errors, performance reports, economy sources/sinks, and behavioral telemetry.
4. Moderated playtests, player observation, support reports, surveys, and community feedback.
5. Competitor teardown and practitioner intuition.

The lower levels generate hypotheses. They do not prove causation.

### Experiment brief

Before changing the game, write:

- **Observation:** what moved, for which cohort and date range?
- **Hypothesis:** if we change Y because evidence Z, metric X should move.
- **Primary metric:** one measure tied to the hypothesis.
- **Guardrails:** metrics that must not regress, such as errors, D1, economy inflation, payer complaints, accessibility, or mobile frame rate.
- **Exposure:** eligible players, control, variant, rollout, and planned duration.
- **Decision rule:** what confidence and practical effect justify shipping?

Roblox Experiments run for 14–60 days. Do not use first-day results for decisions, stop because a favorable line appears, or claim a causal win without statistical significance. Stop or roll back for safety, severe regressions, broken instrumentation, or invalid exposure. Games below roughly 1,000 daily active users may struggle to detect useful effects; use the dashboard's MDE rather than inventing a universal traffic threshold.

### Acquire evidence before diagnosis

Ask for the evidence that actually exists: Creator Dashboard screenshots or exports, cohort windows, release dates, acquisition mix, session recordings, and player feedback. Use Studio or project telemetry for runtime facts when available. State what is missing and never fabricate a metric, cohort, or causal explanation.

## 2. Official Home Recommendations Model

<!-- temporal: 2026-07 -->

Roblox's **Recommended for You** system has two stages:

### Retrieval

The system selects a personalized subset of games using signals such as engagement, retention, and monetization. Sponsored ads, search, charts, friends, teleports, notifications, curation, and external sharing can bring initial players and help a game receive consideration for organic discovery.

### Ranking

The system ranks retrieved candidates for each user. How far organic Home distribution expands depends on users acquired through Recommended for You. Engagement, retention, and monetization from users first acquired through ads, search, friends, social media, or another source do not enter this ranking stage.

This distinction matters:

- external acquisition can create a useful seed cohort and revenue;
- external cohort behavior is still valuable product evidence;
- it does not directly repair weak organic Home-ranking signals.

### Current signal groups

Roblox says signal influence changes over time. Treat this as a dated map, not a permanent formula.

**Most important**

- **Play through rate:** users who play after a Recommended for You impression.
- **First-play bounce rate:** users leaving after a short first play, segmented at under 60 seconds and 61–180 seconds. This is negative.
- **Play days per user:** average unique play days across D1, D2–7, and D8–28 windows.
- **Playtime per user:** capped for this signal at 60 minutes per user, per game, per day.

**Important**

- intentional co-play days per user;
- qualified play sessions per user;
- spend days per user;
- Robux spent per user.

These are per-user averages. Smaller games are not automatically disadvantaged by lower total player counts.

### Explore, expand, and context

Roblox explores a game with cohorts and can expand distribution when those cohorts respond well. Impression changes are also affected by:

- game updates and gameplay changes;
- recommendation-system changes;
- weekly, school-year, summer, and holiday seasonality;
- competing games improving faster;
- audience expansion into less perfectly matched cohorts.

A temporary decline in play through rate can accompany an impression increase. Do not treat every movement as a penalty or secretly changed feature weight.

### Dashboard workflow

In Creator Hub, use **Analytics > Acquisition > Home Recommendations**:

1. Inspect Home recommendation impressions and plays.
2. Check the most important signals first.
3. If those are stable, inspect co-play, qualified sessions, spend days, and Robux spend.
4. Compare against similar-game benchmarks as rough context only. Benchmark games do not affect ranking.
5. Segment other acquisition sources separately.

## 3. Diagnose Metrics Without Single-Cause Thinking

### Low play through rate or thumbnail QPTR

Likely hypotheses:

- icon or thumbnail is unreadable at actual mobile size;
- the image does not communicate genre, action, fantasy, or tone;
- packaging attracts an audience the game cannot satisfy;
- the premise is too familiar without a clear distinction;
- a recent impression expansion reached a broader cohort.

Evidence to collect:

- Home Recommendation play through rate;
- thumbnail personalization QPTR by thumbnail and winning segment;
- qualified plays and average playtime per active thumbnail;
- mobile and desktop previews;
- mismatch between packaging promise and observed first session.

Do not use generic clickbait. A higher click rate paired with worse bounce or retention is not a win.

### High first-play bounce or weak early session survival

Investigate in this order:

1. join failures, crashes, errors, device memory, frame rate, and long loading;
2. metadata-to-game promise mismatch;
3. unclear controls or goal;
4. mandatory menus, dialogue, character creation, or tutorial before meaningful action;
5. first payoff arriving too late;
6. dead or confusing social spaces;
7. platform-specific input or UI failure.

Instrument milestones such as join complete, player gains control, first meaningful action, first reward, core loop complete, and session exit. Track negative outcomes too, such as a failed fight or blocked purchase prompt.

### Low D1 retention

Roblox points to three broad areas: core loop, first-time user experience, and performance.

Useful hypotheses:

- the core loop is understandable but not enjoyable;
- players enjoy one cycle but see no reason to return;
- onboarding teaches mechanics without communicating purpose;
- progression is invisible or the first goal feels arbitrary;
- starter resources do not let players sample the fun;
- mobile, localization, accessibility, or reliability failures affect a segment.

A brief tutorial or contextual tooltips can help. “No tutorial” is not a rule. Teach only the essentials, get to meaningful play quickly, deliver a joyful first payoff, and preview future progress.

**Practitioner heuristics:**
- Instrument Funnels on every tutorial step to find the exact drop-off step, then fix that step specifically rather than redesigning the whole flow.
- "Show, don't tell" is a strong default for younger audiences: let players learn by doing (plant a seed and watch it grow) rather than reading a text block. Some control schemes still require text; keep it brief and contextual.
- Give a concrete reason to return tomorrow: a crop that finishes growing, a daily reward that escalates, a friend's base to visit.

### Low D7 or D30 retention

Do not reduce this to adding daily rewards. Investigate:

- short-, medium-, and long-term goals;
- progression speed and difficulty;
- content variety and mastery depth;
- collections, identity, customization, or status;
- healthy co-play, parties, guilds, competition, and cooperation;
- endgame and recurring reasons to return;
- LiveOps cadence and whether updates deepen the core loop;
- economy inflation or old content becoming obsolete.

D7 often exposes progression weakness. D30 often exposes endgame, content cadence, social value, or exhaustion. The boundary is not absolute.

**Practitioner heuristics:**
- A week of distinct content or goals gives D7 something to chase: a new zone, a rank, a collectible set, a limited-time event.
- Social-flex features (rare cosmetics, leaderboard placement, "admin abuse"-style novelty items players show off) give returning players something to signal status with.
- Live events on a regular cadence give lapsed players a reason to re-open the game.

### Low average session time

Check whether players reach the fun, then whether the loop sustains interest:

- time to first meaningful choice;
- action density versus waiting and travel;
- reward feedback and goal clarity;
- loop variety and escalating challenge;
- social interaction where it genuinely fits;
- performance degradation in longer sessions;
- natural stopping points and return hooks.

**Practitioner heuristic:** give every core-loop action immediate feedback. A rock hit plays a sound and adds slight camera shake; a coin collected pops and increments a visible counter. SFX + VFX on small actions makes the loop feel alive. Test whether feedback density actually moves your playtime before assuming it will.

Longer is not always better. Respect natural sessions; do not trap players with friction or punish leaving.

### Low payer conversion

Investigate product value and purchase friction:

- can players find and understand the shop?
- is the product useful, expressive, durable, or fun?
- does the product fit the player's current progression?
- are there transparent options at several price points?
- does onboarding show value before asking for payment?
- does the funnel fail before or after a Roblox purchase prompt?

A lower-cost first-purchase offer is one hypothesis, not a default. Measure downstream retention, refund/support sentiment, and economy impact.

**Practitioner heuristics:**
- A very cheap starter pack (under 50 Robux) removes the "first purchase" barrier; the goal is converting a non-payer into a payer, not maximizing that transaction.
- Cheap repeatable consumable developer products (e.g., 19 Robux to double offline earnings on login) build a purchasing habit without requiring a large commitment.

### Low ARPPU or ARPDAU

Low ARPPU can mean the catalog lacks depth for engaged payers, but it can also reflect audience, regional pricing, product mix, or a healthy low-pressure economy. Consider durable and consumable options, seasonal products, and meaningful catalog variety.

Always inspect ARPDAU and payer concentration. High ARPPU with low ARPDAU can mean revenue depends on a narrow subset. Do not design around “whales” or use coercive scarcity, deceptive odds, pay-to-escape friction, or manipulative loss aversion.

**Practitioner heuristic:** tiered pricing ("small / medium / large fries") gives engaged payers somewhere to go: a basic pack, a pro pack, and an expensive overpowered pack. The expensive tier exists for players who want to spend; the cheap tiers keep the majority comfortable. Test whether your audience actually has a high-end segment before building for one.

### Declining impressions

Do not assume a shadow penalty. Check:

- Home signal changes by their documented priority;
- recent updates and regression dates;
- acquisition-source mix;
- seasonality;
- broader-cohort exploration;
- competing games and changing audience preferences;
- a Creator Dashboard reduced-exposure banner.

## 4. Positioning and Idea Validation

### The purple-ocean lens

**Heuristic:** seek proven demand with a clear twist rather than a pure clone or an idea with no demonstrated audience.

Use it as a research lens:

1. **Demand:** are players already seeking this fantasy, mechanic, or genre?
2. **Supply:** which games serve it, how concentrated is the audience, and what do reviews or communities dislike?
3. **Difference:** can a player explain this version's distinction in one sentence?
4. **Roblox fit:** does it benefit from avatars, co-play, user identity, short sessions, touch controls, or social graph?
5. **Production fit:** can this team deliver the content, moderation, economy, and update cadence?
6. **Evidence:** what cheap prototype or packaging test could falsify the premise?

Treat third-party estimates as directional. Public CCU, favorites, visits, review activity, social views, Steam wishlists, and Google Trends measure different populations and can be gamed or misread.

### Trend lifecycle

**Heuristic:** Roblox trends tend to move through three phases:

1. **First to market:** an original concept captures initial demand with little competition.
2. **Saturation:** clones and templates flood in; the player base disperses; most copies die.
3. **Mutation:** survivors re-package with a new title, custom thumbnail, or altered core loop. Straight copies of the original's title and thumbnail format fail and can trigger metadata penalties (§6).

If you are entering a trend in phase 2 or 3, a straight clone is the worst position. You need a meaningful twist or an underserved sub-audience.

### Off-platform demand signals

**Heuristic:** demand proven elsewhere de-risks a Roblox launch:

- Indie games with hundreds of thousands of Steam wishlists or millions of web-game plays show proven desire for the core concept.
- Gameplay videos pulling millions of views, especially with younger audiences, predict the concept can explode on Roblox.
- Being the first to bring a highly demanded fantasy to Roblox in a polished way is a strong entry point.

Check the Roblox side too: search for the concept's keywords. Is it actually done well? A theme saturated with basic RP/sims (airports, firefighters) can host a different genre entirely (action-checkpoint, extraction shooter). That gap is the opportunity.

### Premise checks

A useful concept should answer:

- What does the player repeatedly do?
- What fantasy or identity does that action serve?
- What changes after each cycle?
- Why is this better with other players?
- What can be shown honestly in one icon and one thumbnail?
- What remains fun without spending?
- What production burden grows with success?

### Core-loop design

Write the loop as:

> **Action → feedback/reward → progression choice → more expressive or demanding action**

Audit:

- Is the repeated action itself enjoyable?
- Is feedback immediate and readable without relying only on sound, color, or motion?
- Does progression create decisions, not only larger numbers?
- Can a new player complete a meaningful cycle quickly?
- Can the primary action be expressed well on touch, gamepad, and keyboard/mouse, or does one platform require a different interaction model?
- Does the loop remain legible on lower-end devices?
- Does co-play improve the experience rather than merely add bodies?

Prototype the uncertain mechanic before building a large content shell. Prioritize from observed player behavior and the cost of being wrong.

**Practitioner heuristic (80/20):** build roughly 80% from proven mechanics, UI, and progression patterns players are already trained on (core loops, upgrade systems, map layouts from top games in the genre), and spend roughly 20% of your differentiation budget on the theme, fantasy, or twist. The ratio is a starting lens, not a law: a genuinely novel mechanic may need more invention, and a reskin may need less. The point is that familiarity lowers the comprehension barrier while novelty supplies the reason to click.

## 5. First-Time User Experience

Design for **play-first teaching**, not “players never read.” Some controls and systems require text. Make instruction brief, contextual, localized, and accessible.

Roblox's retention guidance recommends reaching the fun within about five minutes. Treat that as a diagnostic starting point, not permission to rush a complex control scheme.

A first-session sequence can be:

1. safe arrival with the game responsive;
2. one obvious action and immediate feedback;
3. one small choice that expresses agency;
4. first core-loop completion;
5. a joyful payoff;
6. visible next goals;
7. optional deeper explanation after motivation exists.

Observe representative players rather than relying on teammates who know the game. When testing with minors, use appropriate consent, privacy, safeguarding, and moderated research practices. Do not collect unnecessary personal data.

**Practitioner heuristics for mobile friction:**
- Mobile UX fails by "death by a thousand cuts": each tiny friction point is tolerable alone but they accumulate until the player quits.
- Hand the game to a target-demo player on a phone or tablet, explain nothing, and watch. UX failures, stuck points, and frustrations surface immediately.
- Remove tap tedium: if upgrading takes 500 taps, add "Buy 100" / "Max Buy" buttons on the HUD.
- Keep maps compact and action-dense. Excessive walking between points of interest kills engagement, especially on mobile. Proven compact layouts (floating-island style, hub-and-spoke) get players into the action faster.

### Accessibility and device coverage

At minimum check:

- touch targets and thumb reach;
- gamepad focus and keyboard/mouse controls;
- readable text at supported text sizes;
- sufficient contrast and symbols in addition to color;
- captions or visual cues for sound-only information;
- reduced-motion behavior;
- localization expansion and bidirectional layout where relevant;
- lower-end mobile memory, thermal load, frame rate, and network conditions.

Cross-reference `roblox-input`, `roblox-ui-design`, `roblox-localization`, `roblox-performance`, `roblox-audio`, and `roblox-animation-vfx` for implementation.

## 6. Packaging and Metadata

### Official requirements and behavior

Use accurate, original metadata. Roblox can reduce exposure for:

- giveaway-led metadata;
- mismatched metadata and gameplay;
- non-unique games with metadata and place files closely resembling existing games.

Quality status is reclassified with updates. Reduced-exposure experiences receive a Creator Dashboard banner that updates daily.

Icons should be square and at least 512×512. Thumbnails should be 16:9 and ideally 1920×1080. Preview both at small mobile sizes. Keep essential details away from areas Roblox overlays with metadata.

### Thumbnail personalization

For Home personalization:

1. Activate 2–5 accurate thumbnails.
2. Roblox initially explores them across users, then allocates more impressions to winners by segment while retaining exploration traffic.
3. Inspect impressions, qualified plays, average playtime, QPTR, and winning segment.
4. Keep multiple thumbnails active so personalization can adapt.
5. Test new thumbnails around a major game or content update, then avoid changing them again until the next update.

QPTR here means qualified plays divided by Home recommendation impressions. The broader Discovery signal table separately calls its top conversion signal **play through rate**. Do not silently treat every dashboard's denominator or qualification rules as identical.

### Practitioner creative heuristics

Use these as starting points, not ranking rules:

- communicate one dominant fantasy or action;
- prioritize subject, action, emotion, and contrast over clutter;
- make the image understandable at actual display size;
- use honest in-game content and visual fidelity;
- avoid tiny text and UI-like thumbnail layouts;
- use title wording for searchable clarity and differentiation, not keyword stuffing;
- test whether the package attracts players who actually enjoy the first session.

**Design specifics (heuristic):**
- Simple backgrounds. Clutter kills CTR.
- 1–2 characters (3 only if the composition demands it; more is visual noise).
- High color contrast: bright subjects popping off the background (yellow character on clear blue sky).
- Exaggerated, instantly readable emotions: manic evil smile, crying/stressed face, troll face.
- Tease a mechanic over the title: text like "Steal at Night" or "Cure the Survivors" gives context and intrigue; the game's name alone usually does not.

**Proven thumbnail formats (heuristic):**
1. **Before & after:** noob vs. pro, cheap vs. expensive split. Works for tycoons and progression games.
2. **First-person perspective:** viewer inside the action. Works for PVP, shooters, RP.
3. **Two-character scene:** conflict or interaction, someone getting outplayed.
4. **One character + action:** maximally readable and simple.
5. **Entirely new concept:** unique to your game's mechanic; highest risk, highest differentiation.

**Creation workflow (heuristic):**
1. Research genre tropes in top games of the niche (e.g., hacker games: masks, green binary, brand rivalries).
2. Rough mockup in a free tool (basic shapes, clip art, text) to fix the layout before committing to detail.
3. Generate or commission from the mockup with a highly specific scene prompt.
4. Iterate with explicit direction ("remove the clouds", "make text larger", "flip the character").
5. Simplify for mobile first. Detailed desktop thumbnails are often unreadable on phones.

**Testing:** A/B test 2–3 thumbnails per week. CTR naturally decays as impressions accumulate, so keep rotating fresh, readable thumbnails. Test around major game or content updates, then let the winner stabilize.

Optional tools:

- [qptr.io](https://qptr.io) previews an icon or thumbnail beside simulated neighbors. It does not measure live Roblox performance.
- [Creator Exchange](https://creatorexchange.io) offers directional market and game estimates. It is not an official Roblox analytics source.

## 7. Monetization With Trust

Good monetization exposes clear value to willing players while the free core remains enjoyable.

Design principles:

- transparent storefront and purchase result;
- several price points and a mix of durable and consumable value;
- no hard-coded Robux prices when Managed Pricing can change them;
- regional pricing where appropriate;
- no deceptive odds, false urgency, disguised purchase buttons, repeated interruption, or punishment for declining;
- no sale that corrupts competitive integrity unless the game's promise clearly supports it;
- server-authoritative granting and idempotent receipt handling.

Price optimization requires enough transactions for statistically useful data. Roblox says it usually needs at least 60,000 transactions over the preceding 30 days. Smaller games should use qualitative value research and carefully scoped experiments rather than pretending a tiny sample proves an optimal price.

Cross-reference `roblox-monetization`, `roblox-security`, and `roblox-data` before implementing purchases.

## 8. Social Design and LiveOps

Social features are not automatically retention features. Define the interaction:

- collaboration, competition, spectatorship, gifting, trading, parties, guilds, or shared creation;
- how solo and new players avoid exclusion;
- moderation and abuse controls;
- scam-resistant trade and gift flows, reporting, and escalation;
- mandatory filtering for player-authored text and the review burden of uploaded content;
- griefing controls that preserve legitimate competition;
- whether server size and matchmaking support the intended behavior;
- how co-play is measured without manufacturing friction.

LiveOps should complement or deepen the core loop. For each event or update, define:

- target audience and KPI;
- intended player actions;
- economy sources, sinks, and reward impact;
- communication before and during the event;
- hourly health checks during launch;
- comparison with pre-event and post-event periods;
- what remains after the temporary event ends.

Do not use event spikes as proof of durable retention. Compare later cohorts and ordinary weeks.

## 9. Audit Workflow

When asked to audit a Roblox game:

### Step 1: Request evidence

Ask for what exists, not an idealized dashboard dump:

- game link and intended audience;
- Home recommendation impressions, play through, bounce, play days, playtime, and important signals;
- acquisition by source;
- first-session retention and onboarding funnel;
- D1, D7, and D30 cohorts;
- session time and playtime;
- payer conversion, ARPDAU, ARPPU, products, and economy health;
- device, locale, and country/region breakdowns;
- errors, crashes, frame rate, and recent update dates;
- thumbnails, icon, title, description, and reduced-exposure banner;
- player feedback and observed sessions.

### Step 2: Establish the baseline

Separate facts, inferences, and unknowns. Mark immature D7/D30 cohorts. Note seasonality, traffic-source changes, events, ads, and releases.

### Step 3: Find the narrowest broken transition

Examples:

- impression → play;
- join → player control;
- control → first meaningful action;
- action → first reward;
- reward → core-loop completion;
- first session → return;
- retained player → value-aware shop visit;
- purchase intent → completed purchase.

### Step 4: Prioritize

Use a simple evidence-weighted score:

> **Priority = expected player impact × confidence × reach ÷ cost and risk**

Do not fabricate precision. A qualitative High/Medium/Low score is often more honest.

### Step 5: Produce an experiment backlog

For each recommendation include:

- evidence and uncertainty;
- hypothesis;
- smallest viable change;
- primary metric and guardrails;
- eligible cohort and segmentation;
- instrumentation required;
- expected decision date;
- rollback trigger.

### Step 6: Preserve the game's identity

Optimization is not a license to turn every game into the same simulator loop. Protect the intended fantasy, audience, tone, accessibility, and creative distinction. Reject metric gains that depend on misleading acquisition or damaged player trust.

## 10. Output Format

Use this structure for a game-design diagnosis:

1. **Verdict:** the highest-leverage constraint.
2. **Evidence:** verified facts and the source/date range.
3. **Unknowns:** missing evidence that could change the diagnosis.
4. **Hypotheses:** ranked, not stated as facts.
5. **Next experiment:** one smallest interpretable intervention.
6. **Metrics:** primary outcome, counter-metrics, and decision rule.
7. **Implementation routing:** which Roblox Brain skills are needed.
8. **Later backlog:** useful work deliberately excluded from the first test.
